# Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R Markdown_ might behave better for you than that other word processor.
One perk is that it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.
You'll also be able to create a label for each figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.
If you label your figures, you can move the figures around and _R Markdown_ will automatically adjust the numbering for you.
No need for you to remember!
So that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have been created for you to assist.
You'll see their use below.

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

We can import pictures that were not created in **R**. In the code chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `goldy.png` in our `figures` directory.
We then give it the caption of "Goldy rendered as a pencil drawing.", the label of "goldy", and specify that this is a figure.
Make note of the different **R** chunk options that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

````
```{r goldy, fig.cap="Goldy rendered as a pencil drawing."}
include_graphics(path = "figures/goldy.png")
```
````

Here is a reference to the Goldy image: Figure `\@ref(fig:goldy)`. Note the use of the `fig:` code here.
By naming the **R** chunk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.
We can also specify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

You can, of course, also create figures using R syntax within a code chunk. 

````
```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.pos='H'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```
````

Similar to our Goldy picture, we reference these figures through calling its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure `\@ref(fig:nice-fig)`. 


*Note:* If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.
