# Mathematics

To use mathematics if you output to an HTML file, add the following at the end of the `index.Rmd` file.

```
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
MathJax.Hub.Config({
  TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "AMS" } }
});
</script>
```


Using LaTeX is the best way to typeset mathematics. One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly. To include an un-numbered equation, use `$$`.

```
$$
\hat{Y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X_{1i}) + \beta_2(X_{2i})
$$
```

To include a numbered equation, use `\begin{equation}` and `\end{equation}` to embed your mathematics rather than `$$`

```
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1(X_{1i}) + \beta_2(X_{2i}) + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}
```
